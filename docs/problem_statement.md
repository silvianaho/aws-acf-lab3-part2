# Problem Statement

Our company wants to spread awareness about COVID-19. With the current pandemic, the company feels that there is a lot of false information circulating regarding the situation.  There is a need to have reliable information for the public, so they can be educated about the pandemic. Therefore, the company plans to create a website that provides insightful information about the pandemic that is easily accessed. The website would include various information such as symptoms of the virus, live updates about the number of cases/ deaths, why people should wear masks and adhere to the rules of social distancing, the debunking of common myths, and false information that is being spread around. The company also plans to be a distributor of masks through the website.
